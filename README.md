Welcome to my tic tac toe game! This game is designed for two players both using the same screen. The text under the scores tells you which players turn it is, player X or player O. Simply click or touch the box in the grid you wish to fill. The first player to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins!
If all boxes are filled and neither player won, the game results in a tie. Click the reset button to reset the game, click the reset scores text if you wish to reset scores to zero. The starting player alternates each game.

I originally was planning to build a simple trivia game but was inspired to build tic tac toe because I thought it would offer a little more challenge and I wanted to see if I could do it. I like the idea of tic tac toe because it involves a little more logic than a trivia game.

One piece of functionality I would like to implement is to make it so the reset button resets the game without reloading the whole page. Also maybe add a button to mute sound effects.

This game was built using HTMl, CSS, Google Fonts, Font Awesome, and JavaScript.
